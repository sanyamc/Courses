Answer1:

a) Model has better performance metrics on training data because that is what is used to create the model. Loosly put; model is an equation 
representing points in space, the points which were used to derive equation will solve the equation than unseen points(test data).

b) We randomize the data selection into training and testing to create a model and not handpick the data for model. This will eliminate 
   any bias that might occur due to manual selection.

c) Model performance usually gives hints; for e.g. if model is working too well than its training data or there is a highly correlated or 
   a predictive column which determines outcome. If later is the case then we don't really need model and just use that column.


Answer 2:
                 Assuming that model predicts if a person is healthy or not healthy
Confusion matrix
              Actual-Healty  Actual-NotHealthy
        Model-Healthy   85   3
        Model-Ill        5   7

TP=40
FP=100
FN=10
TN=850

Sensitivity/Recall = 85/90

Secificity = 7/10 

Precision = 85/88

Accuracy = 92/100

Answer 3: Assuming TPR on y axis and FPR on x axis
a) y=1,x=1 represents threshold of 0
b) y=0,x=0 represents threshold of 1
c) x=0.5,y=0.5 represents threshold of 0.5

Answer 4:
a)
TPR = 0.8, FPR =0.4, Accuracy = 0.7
By Accuracy, TP+TN = 0.7*1000 = 700, FP+FN=300
By TPR, TP/TP+FN = 0.8, TP=4FN
By FPR, FP/FP+TN = 0.4, TN = 0.6FP/0.4

OR 300-FP = 0.25TP
AND700-TP=1.5FP

Solving the above equation, following is CM

TP  FP    400  200
FN  TN    100  300

b) Threshold is <=0.5
